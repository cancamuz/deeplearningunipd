Homeworks of the Deep Learning Course (University of Padova), 2022

This repository contains the homeworks for the course of 2022, which were done by me.
The course introduces the basic concepts related to Deep Learning, i.e. machine learning through neural networks.
The mathematical concepts necessary for a full understanding of the subject were recalled. Feedforward deep neural networks and the related techniques of regularization and optimization of learning were examined. The basic concepts related to convolutional networks were introduced. For the treatment of sequences, recurrent neural networks were presented, with particular emphasis on the use of LSTM and analogous units. Finally, autoencoders and deep generative models were discussed.

The topics of the teaching were:
- Deep Feedforward Neural Networks;
- Regularization for deep learning;
- Optimization for deep model learning;
- Basic concepts for convolutional neural networks;
- Recurrent Neural Networks and Transformers for sequence modelling;
- Autoencoders;
- Deep generative models;
- TensorFlow.

The grades of the homeworks:
 HW1 = 100
 HW2 = 95
 HW3 = 100
 HW4 = 90
 HW5 = 100
 HW6 = 100
